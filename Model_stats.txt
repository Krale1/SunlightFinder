Sunlight Finder Model Stats:

Based on the model evaluation results, here are the key statistics:

Overall Accuracy: 91.0% (0.9096)
This means the model correctly predicts whether a cafe is in sunlight or not about 91% of the time
True Negatives: 201 (correctly predicted no sunlight)
False Positives: 15 (incorrectly predicted sunlight)
False Negatives: 17 (incorrectly predicted no sunlight)
True Positives: 121 (correctly predicted sunlight)

Detailed Metrics:

For "No Sun" (0):
Precision: 92% (when it predicts no sun, it's right 92% of the time)
Recall: 93% (it correctly identifies 93% of all actual no-sun cases)
F1-score: 93%

For "Sun" (1):
Precision: 89% (when it predicts sun, it's right 89% of the time)
Recall: 88% (it correctly identifies 88% of all actual sun cases)
F1-score: 88%

Feature Importance (what factors most influence the predictions):
Hour of day: 81.7% (by far the most important feature)
Longitude: 7.2%
Latitude: 7.1%
Bar orientation: 3.4%
Outdoor seating: 0.6%

Key Insights:
The model performs very well with 91% accuracy
It's slightly better at predicting "no sun" cases (93% F1-score) than "sun" cases (88% F1-score)
The time of day (hour) is by far the most important factor in predicting sunlight, which makes sense since sun position changes throughout the day
Location (latitude/longitude) is the second most important factor
Bar orientation and outdoor seating have relatively small impacts on the predictions
